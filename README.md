# IPCC
In the report of IPCC published in August 2021, it was stated that the rise of global
temperature is expected to be 1.5-2°C in the next ten years. One of the important points
depicted in that report is that although reducing the emission of CO2 creates a positive effect
on climate change, global warming will be stable if the sanctions we imposed are successfully
performed for 20-30 years. However, the changes in water cycles and the unprecedented
increase in sea surface temperature affect all living organisms in the ecosystem.
In this study, the relationship between the changes of sea surface temperature data of
the European Environmental Agency and the population growth data retrieved from the World
Bank is interpreted with Spearman analysis. In addition to this, for the next 20 years, the
average change of sea temperature is predicted with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and
ARIMA. To that end, rnn and tsbox libraries of R are utilized.
Preceding works had discussed the effects of climate change on biodiversity,
hydrological status, teleconnections among seas, and undersea flows. Different from these
studies, our findings assert that there is a monotonic increasing relationship between
population growth and average sea temperature. Moreover, the unfavorable effects of the
temperature increase in the Mediterranian Sea on the Gulf Stream are discussed. If there will
be no decrease in population growth in the next ten years, we expect a 0.2°C increase in the
average temperature across the world, according to the prediction results obtained with
ARIMA and RNN. Even though the sanctions imposed to reduce carbon emissions are tightly
employed, we expect new requirements associated with climate change and anticipate major
problems caused by individual consumption, if the population growth is not planned.
